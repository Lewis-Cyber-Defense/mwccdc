# Notes

## WARNING
Many of the scripts in this folder are commonly used on penetration testing assesments, and have been included for their viability as programs to identify the "lay of the land". In the event that you use these, it is advised that you remove them from the system entirely, unless you want to give your red team a nice gift.

## Scripts
- PEASS-ng Suite: Just run it, and it runs through a series of enumeration commands, highlighting potential vulnerabilities
- LinEnum: Enumerates Linux systems `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
- Seatbelt: From the [Ghostpack](https://github.com/GhostPack), Seatbelt runs a variety of checks on various components of Windows systems
